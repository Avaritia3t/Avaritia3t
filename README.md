Hello, my name is Mathew. 

I spent most of my life hesitant to program, but have picked it up with a passion! Currently interested in developing real-world, applicable projects, and expanding on my current
skillset to realize my goals. Currently very good at developing algorithms to solve problems, now just learnin the language needed to implement those algorithms!
Interested in becoming a business analyst. 

Currently learning: 
  - Intermediate Python (lambda functions, threading, data structures, advanced logic operations)
  - Learning beginner Flask
  - Beginner/Intermediate SQL Server/PostgreSQL (bulk data copy, sprocs, advanced queries, human input, triggers, timed functions)
  - Learning beginner Visual Basic
  - brushing up on HTML/CSS structure and best practices.

After this, I'll be working on advanced HTML/CSS, tensorflow/spacy Python libraries, Node.js, and Javascript.

Iâ€™d love to collaborate with and learn from others interested in developing applications from start to finish. I learn best by tackling real problems, not working on sample
exercises (although I do love a good brain teaser).
